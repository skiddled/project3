    <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>Playing games has been a constant interest of mine since I was little. Lucky to have an older brother who got me into video games, I got my Steam account created at the age of 5 and have been playing games ever since.</p>
      <p>As of now, the games I play the most are Rocket League, Rainbow Six Siege, and Escape From Tarkov.</p>

    <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>Playing sports started when I was young, similar to gaming. I started with soccer in a small league for a few years and now I've been playing any sports me and my friends want to. With the weather getting warmer, we've gone back to playing basketball.</p>

    <h2>Crypto</h2>
      <p>Getting into crypto started in 2017-2018. For me, crypto is a good way to learn about the possibilities of technology. But more importantly, it's a good way to get money.</p>
